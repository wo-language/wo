### Wo is a fork of Go

Wo offers an alternative syntax and functionality to the Go programming language. It aims to be interoperable with Go.

Here is one example.

Go:
```go
r, err := os.Open(fileName)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
```
Wo:
```go
r = os!Open(fileName)
```
as well as
```go
r, log("Oh no: ", err) = os.Open(fileName)
```

Besides syntactical and formatting difference, it also offers a functional difference, notably the `set`:

```go
map... etc.
```
